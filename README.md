#### The dataset used in this visualization is https://github.com/AdityaJ7/Parametric-models/blob/master/Dataset/telco_customer.csv
#### The time to event of the teleco dataset has been modelled using the four different parametric models. 
#### Here the time is the tenure(in months) for which the customer stayed in the company and the event is whether they churned or not.

# Churn By Contract
### The image contains the implementation of different parametric models to see the churn probability on the basis of User contract with the company.

# Churn By Subscribed
### The image contains the implementation of different parametric models to see the churn probability on the basis of the subsciption of the user with Streaming Tv.

# Churn By Gender
### The image contains the implementation of different parametric models to see the churn probability on the basis of the user gender.

# Churn By Partner
### The image contains the implementation of different parametric models to see the churn probability on the basis if the user has a partner or not.
