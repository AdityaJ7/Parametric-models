### The dataset used in this visualization is https://github.com/AdityaJ7/Parametric-models/blob/master/Dataset/telco_customer.csv
### The time to event of the teleco dataset has been modelled using the four different parametric models 
### Here the time is the tenure(in months) for which the customer stayed in the company and the event is whether they churned or not
